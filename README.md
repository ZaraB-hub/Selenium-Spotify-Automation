<h1>Spotify Automation Testing</h1>
This repository contains the automation tests for Spotify using Selenium. The tests are written in Java and use the Selenium WebDriver to interact with the Spotify web player.
There is also testing documentation

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
To get started with the tests, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

Java
Selenium WebDriver
WebDriver for the browser you wish to use (e.g. ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)
JUnit (testing frameworks)
You will also need to have a Spotify account to be able to log in and test the functionality of the application.

Running the Tests
The tests are organized into different test classes based on the functionality/scenario being tested. To run a specific test class, navigate to the directory containing the tests and run the test.
